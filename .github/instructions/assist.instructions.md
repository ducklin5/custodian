Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.
- Follow Rust's naming conventions (snake_case for variables and functions, CamelCase for types).
- Use `Option` and `Result` types for functions that can fail or return nothing.
- Prefer immutable variables and data structures; use `mut` only when necessary.
- avoid using negative conditions in if statements; prefer positive checks.
